# Contributing

**We'd love to have you work ~for u-~.. with us! Whether by...**

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed anything significant, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code is maintainable.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/Z-100/GeoPal/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers this project. 
<br/>
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub issues
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Z-100/GeoPal/issues) to track public bugs. 
<br/>
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Z-100/GeoPal/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use Tabs (4 spaces/ Tab) rather than spaces for indentation
  * At least in code, all the docs are made with 2 spaces

## License
By contributing, you agree that all of your contributions will be licensed under this project's [MIT License](https://github.com/Z-100/GeoPal/blob/master/LICENSE).
